This is a short document for Details! API, describing attributes, combat, container, actor.
It still is incomplete, we are working on.

This is a diagram showing the structure: http://i.imgur.com/vyTjpFh.png



Attributes:
=======================================
All these keys are globals:

DETAILS_ATTRIBUTE_DAMAGE = 1
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_DAMAGEDONE = 1
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_DPS = 2
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_DAMAGETAKEN = 3
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_FRIENDLYFIRE = 4
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_FRAGS = 5
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_ENEMIES = 6
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_VOIDZONES = 7

DETAILS_ATTRIBUTE_HEAL = 2
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_HEALDONE = 1
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_HPS = 2
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_OVERHEAL = 3
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_HEALTAKEN = 4
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_HEALENEMY = 5
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_HEALPREVENTED = 6

DETAILS_ATTRIBUTE_ENERGY = 3
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_REGENMANA = 1
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_REGENRAGE = 2
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_REGENENERGY = 3
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_REGENRUNE = 4

DETAILS_ATTRIBUTE_MISC = 4
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_CCBREAK = 1
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_RESS = 2

DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_DEATH = 5
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_DCOOLDOWN = 6
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_BUFFUPTIME = 7
DETAILS_SUBATTRIBUTE_DEBUFFUPTIME = 8



TL;DR
=======================================
Details! has three main objects: Combat, Container and Actor:

"Combat" holds containers, when a fight is gone, the "Current Combat" is placed inside the History Segment.
"Container" holds Actors.
"Actor" has members telling what the player or npc has made in the combat.

"Combat" has 4 indexes: [1] holds the Damage Container [2] Healing [3] Energy [4] Misc.
These indexes are called "Attributes"

"Actor" has different data depending on which container the actor are, for instance, if is a Damage Actor, it will have members like damage_taken, friendly fire,
if is a Healing Actor, it will have members for overheal, absorbs etc.
Actors also have tables for spells and targets.
An Actor only is created inside a container when it performs an action which fits the container, for instance, if the player didn't restored any energy/mana/rage, etc,
it won't have an actor inside the Energy Container.

"History Segment" is a table, it holds combat objects of previous combats.

==========
|    COMBAT     | = { [1] = {DAMAGE CONTAINER}, [2] = {HEAL CONTAINER}, [3] = {ENERGY CONTAINER}, [4] = {MISC CONTAINER} }
==========

============
|    CONTAINER    | = { ACTORS }
============

==========
|      ACTOR     | = {attribute_keys, spells = {}, targets = {}}
==========
attribute keys are the members which holds all the totals made by the actor (see more below).
spells = {spellid = {SPELL}} targets = {["targetname"] = amount}



Getting Details! Object:
=======================================
Just get the global 'Details', for instance:
local details = _G.Details



Important Functions:
=======================================
Details:Format (number, formatString)
if formatString is nil, Format uses current format chosen on details options panel.

Details:GetActorsOnDamageCache()
only usable while in combat, it returns a numeric table with all damage actors in the group (combatlog flag matching 0x00000007).
the table is always sorted and only contains players in the raid or party.

Details:GetActorsOnHealingCache()
only usable while in combat, it returns a numeric table with all healing actors in the group (combatlog flag matching 0x00000007).
the table is always sorted and only contains players in the raid or party.

*For out of combat, energy and misc containers or get all actors even pets, enemies etc, you may use Container:SortByKey(key) and Container:ListActors().

Getting a Combat Object:
=======================================
combat = Details:GetCurrentCombat()
returns the current combat object.

bestResult, encounterTable = Details.storage:GetBestFromPlayer (encounterDiff, encounterId, playerRole, playerName)
query the storage for the best result of the player on the encounter.
encounterDiff = raid difficult ID (15 for heroic, 16 for mythic).
encounterId = may be found on "id" member getting combat:GetBossInfo().

Examples:
======================================= ---

1) Get the player damage, heal, dps and hps:

local combat = Details:GetCurrentCombat()
local damageActor = combat:GetActor (DETAILS_ATTRIBUTE_DAMAGE, UnitName ("player"))
local healingActor = combat:GetActor (DETAILS_ATTRIBUTE_HEAL, UnitName ("player"))
or
local damageActor = Details:GetActor ("current", DETAILS_ATTRIBUTE_DAMAGE, Details.playername)
local healingActor = Details:GetActor ("current", DETAILS_ATTRIBUTE_HEAL, Details.playername)

local totalDamage, totalHeal = damageActor.total, healingActor.total

local effectiveDps, effectiveHps = totalDamage / combat:GetCombatTime(), totalHeal / combat:GetCombatTime()
local activeDps, activeHps = totalDamage / damageActor:Tempo(), totalHeal / healingActor:Tempo()


2) Get a list of all overhealing:

-- get the combat, here we want the current combat:
local combat = Details:GetCurrentCombat()

-- as we want all players, we get here the container which stores all healing actors:
local healingContainer = combat:GetContainer (DETAILS_ATTRIBUTE_HEAL)

-- sort the container with the key "totalover" - we got this key from "Keys for Healing Actors":
healingContainer:SortByKey ("totalover")

-- now just iterate among the actors:
local actorsFound = 0
for i, actor in healingContainer:ListActors() do

	-- inside the container has all entities which made any heal during the combat, here we check if the actor is a player for our group.
	if (actor:IsGroupPlayer()) then
		actorsFound = actorsFound + 1
	end
end


3) Damage done to an add called "Grand Corruptor U'rogg":

local combat = Details:GetCurrentCombat()
local damageContainer = combat:GetContainer (DETAILS_ATTRIBUTE_DAMAGE)
local targetName = "Grand Corruptor U'rogg"

there is two ways for do this:

1 - with an external table:

	local actorsAmount = {}
	for i, actor in damageContainer:ListActors() do
		local amount = actor.targets [targetName]
		if (amount and amount >= 1) then
			tinsert (actorsAmount, {name = actor:name(), total = amount})
		end
	end

	table.sort (actorsAmount, function (a,b) return a.total > b.total end)

2 - replacing the member "custom" on the actor:

	for i, actor in damageContainer:ListActors() do
		if (actor:IsGroupPlayer()) then
			local amount = actor.targets [targetName]
			if (amount and amount >= 1) then
				actor.custom = amount
			else
				actor.custom = 0
			end
		else
			actor.custom = 0
		end
	end

	damageContainer:SortByKey ("custom")

	local actorsDamagedTheTarget = 0
	for i, actor in damageContainer:ListActors() do
		actorsDamagedTheTarget = actorsDamagedTheTarget + 1
	end


4) Get everyone who took damage from an ability:

local combat = Details:GetCurrentCombat()
local damageContainer = combat:GetContainer (DETAILS_ATTRIBUTE_DAMAGE)

local targetSpell = 183449 --Felfire Volley from hellfire assault encounter
local sourceNpc = "Gorebound Felcaster"
--in cases of multi-language auras or displays, we doesn't want to hardcode the npc name.
sourceNpc = damageContainer:GetSpellSource (targetSpell)

--reset the custom member on all actors:
for i, actor in damageContainer:ListActors() do
	actor.custom = 0
end

local source = damageContainer:GetActor (sourceNpc)
local felfireVolleySpell = source:GetSpell (targetSpell)
if (felfireVolleySpell) then
	for playerName, amount in pairs (felfireVolleySpell.targets) do
		--players who took damage from this ability
		--now this result may be placed on a external table or .custom may also be used
		local targetActor = damageContainer:GetActor (playerName)
		targetActor.custom = amount
	end
end

damageContainer:SortByKey ("custom")


5) Get damage taken by an enemy

local combat = Details:GetCurrentCombat()
